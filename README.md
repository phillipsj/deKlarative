# deKlarative
## A Kotlin based declaritive web framework.

I personally like a more decalritive approach when buidling applications. It makes it easier to follow the logic and to reason about what  you are doing. I have haven't seen a lot of declaritive style web frameworks, so I decided to try to build my own. 

This project will use some other great libraries to accomplish the goals that I want. There will be a focus on greating a nice DSL for declaring your app and will include both full pages and APIs. I will try to keep the design out in the open as I work on it and any feedback will be appreciated. I will try to make my overall goals clear.
